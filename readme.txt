Auto-redirects link format posts to a URL specified in the content area.

== Description ==

If you've ever written a post using the 'link' post format, you know that the experience leaves a little something to be desired in most themes.

The sole purpose of this plugin is to add a little magic to how your users interact with these link posts by simply redirecting to the given URL when somebody visits your post. That's it.

The redirect is only triggered on published and scheduled posts of any type where the post format is set as 'link'.

== Installation ==

1. Visit the Plugins > Add New screen in your WordPress admin, and search for "Redirect Link Format".
1. Click "Install Now", and when that's finished, click "Activate".
